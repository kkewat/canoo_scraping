"Canoo is an American automotive company based in Torrance, California, that develops and manufactures electric vehicles.[2][3] Canoo's research & development team is based in Michigan, in the Detroit region (Auburn Hills, Livonia), and production operations are in Justin, Texas. The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.[4]
"
"Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer.[5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern.[6][7]
"
"In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive.[8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.[9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.[10]
"
"
"
"In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle.[11]
"
"In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group, the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14]
"
"In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.[15][16]
"
"In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage.[17]
"
"In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21]
"
"A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22]
"
"In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24]
"
"In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26]
"
"In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29]
"
"
"
"On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31]
"
"It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32]
"
"On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34]
"
"On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.""[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38]
"
"On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December 2022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40]
"
"In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.
"
"Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44]  In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46]
"
"On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48]
"
"In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50]
"
"Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56]
"
"In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59]

"Well, if there’s one thing our favorite electric vehicle startups have all shared, it’s a penchant for innovation — from luxury hatchbacks with third-row seats and SUVs with “falcon-wing” doors, to trucks with gear tunnels and supercar suspensions, to 500-mile sedans powered by 500-plus-hp motors tiny and light enough to fit in a roll-aboard suitcase. Now we’re adding to that roster the 2024 Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle — a 21-window retro-tastic van with mosh-pit seating, swappable “top-hat” bodies, and a truly fresh take on vehicle life-cycle planning.Is Canoo viable?It’s a question worth asking about any EV startup that hasn’t yet produced cars yet, and things indeed looked a little shaky last year for the California-based firm. But like Rivian, Canoo is lining up fleet customers to keep the lights on (e.g., Walmart has ordered 4,500 LDVs, or Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles). Unlike Rivian, Canoo will only be selling to fleet customers for the first year of production. (Those customers will also hopefully soon include the U.S. military, for Canoo's Light Tactical Vehicle that we also reviewed.) These fleets will expose the vehicle to harder use than retail families would, and so will swiftly and efficiently uncover any remaining development issues prior to the retail launch of the passenger-carrying Lifestyle Vehicle.The VW Microbus–esque Lifestyle Vehicle was the first Canoo to break cover, and a simpler delivery-van version of that body is the first to launch. The first 120 ""Gamma"" prototypes of various models have been built in Livonia, Michigan, at Roush Industries (we drove one of these not quite final-final models). Roush has provided worker training and assembly services, but the tooling and manufacturing process all belong to Canoo, and the employees overseeing them have either been flown in from Oklahoma or hired locally by Canoo with plans to relocate to Oklahoma when official production migrates there in the first quarter of 2023.2024 electric vehicles:Tesla Cybertruck production faces 'enormous challenges,' admits MuskThe first official customer vehicles began rolling off this temporary line on November 17, bound for Walmart, NASA, and other fleet buyers. Pickup variants (in regular, extended, and crew cab configurations) are still part of the product plan, and we’re assured features like the drop-down sides, gear-tunnel drawers, extending pickup floor, and “barn-door” tailgate are still part of the plan. The larger, more angular Multi-Purpose Delivery Van (MPDV) program is also still active. And current production plans call for initially producing more skateboards than top hats, suggesting the company sees a market for this low-profile, fully by-wire platform.Take a look inside the Lifestyle Vehicle.Simply climbing aboard is a unique experience. The front doors are wide and rectangular, meaning there’s open space right where your head usually ducks under an A-pillar. The rear doors are also wide and swing open on rear-mounted hinges — like on a Rolls-Royce or Lincoln Continental Coach Door. And as in those cars, the main bench seat is positioned behind the C-pillar, leaving floorspace sufficient for practicing yoga (or mounting a wheelchair ramp). Premium models get jump seats that mount to the doors, with retractable seat bottoms and full three-point belts. When deployed, their occupants face each other, and unoccupied cushions can serve as ottomans for the outboard bench-seat occupants. Two more jump seats fold down behind each front seatback, but they’re only for use when stopped, with the front seatbacks leaned forward. The rear-door windows don’t go down, but the rear quarter windows do, and there will be an option to have the little vista windows around the roof perimeter pop open.When folded up against the front seatbacks, wings on the temporary jump seats serve as outboard armrests for the front occupants — which they need, because moving the front seats far enough inboard for the driver’s feet to clear the front wheels puts the doors out of reach. The pedal environment is perfect, but while there’s a single center armrest between the seats, there’s no room for a center console, and two burly linebackers might rub shoulders.There’s no “dashboard.” A digital speedometer readout and indicators for the turn signal and drive gear are centered at the base of the windshield. Below this is another window offering a view of what’s immediately in front. That panel may one day open to access stowage space ahead of the front occupants’ feet. Multiple thin pillars separating the various glass panels ahead of the official A-pillar didn’t prove distracting and overall visibility is excellent.A 10.0-inch touchscreen mounts to the driver's A-pillar, within easy reach of the steering wheel. It controls most secondary functions (rails above and below are planned, for steadying a hand on bumpyroads). That screen seems designed to minimize distraction, offering few compelling infographics… yet. Wiper controls share the turn-signal stalk, while the right stalk serves as the gear selector. Climate controls are arrayed across a slim aluminum cross-car beam, within reach of the passenger. The HVAC system is convective, relying on circulating air, not air that directly blows on the occupants. As such there are no vent registers visible except a row along the top of the windshield. In 40-degree weather, the 72-degree setting quickly felt comfortable with no dry eyes, but the tougher test will be how quickly such a system can make occupants feel cool on a hot day — especially in a vehicle with so much glass.Canoo’s seating arrangement prioritizes excellent comfort for four or five, passable comfort for seven (in those premium models), and not much cargo flexibility — of the 130 cubic feet of space available in the LDV, there’s only room for 13.0 cubes of stuff (or three golf bags) behind the folding-backrest, non-removable rear seat. It’s NOT a minivan, remember?Is it a legit muscle van?Riding on the wheelbase of a Toyota Prius with by-wire steering controlled by a square steering “wheel” twirling a lightning-quick rack (1.2 turns lock-to-lock), it feels nimble and quick-witted, and the turning circle is crazy tight. The skateboard chassis features patented composite transverse leaf springs of variable cross-section, which helps keep the entire suspension low—the tops of the shocks are about even with the tops of the tires. The LV swallows speed bumps with suppleness, while minimal body lean, squat, and dive suggest a certain sportiness. This isn’t a “forward-control” van like a Microbus, but the upright, forward seating position places the driver’s eyes unusually close to the steering axle. Combine this with that speedy steering and we managed to clip the first curb or two. Braking regen is programmable in three levels ranging from unobtrusively light to full one-pedal driving.2025 EV models:A first look at Cadillac's 2025 electric Escalade IQThe rear-mounted 200-pound motor, which Canoo designed, builds, and holds 58 patents on, is capable of 350 hp and 304 lb-ft. Canoo envisions making output programmable between 200 and 350 hp, with lower power boosting efficiency, reducing wear and tear, and potentially lowering use-based insurance costs. It was set to 285 hp for our drive, and in a 4,750-pound vehicle with three people onboard, its weight-to-power was worse than that of a Chevy Bolt EV or Nissan Leaf. Canoo’s 9.7:1 gear reduction ratio is notably shorter than those two, though, so it accelerates more snappily, but it’s certainly no rail gun. A future two-motor AWD version with both motors cranked to max output may wear the muscle-van moniker more comfortably.What's their unique sales proposition?Canoo originally proposed an all-subscription model, but inflation and volatile interest rates complicate such a model. Retail sales and leasing will primarily be handled online and directly with the factory. Canoo contends that the value of a vehicle is ultimately determined by its second and third owners. Toward that end, the company’s skateboard design prioritizes longevity and quick, easy repairability with lifelong upgradability. A powertrain swap takes two hours, and the entire body top hat shouldn’t take much longer. In this way, the Canoo recalls a different vintage VW—the Beetle—many of which enjoyed second lives as sand rails and dune buggies.Give us the bottom line.We’ve loved the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle’s exterior design from the moment we saw it (especially the pickup). We’re intrigued with the interior layout and we look forward to spending more time in it to answer questions like, is supreme footstool comfort for two rear occupants some of the time worth making occupants six and seven miserable sitting sideways? Is loading bulky stuff in through the back doors as easy/easier than loading it in the hatch? Is there enough luggage room for reasonable trips with four or more occupants?2024 Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle SpecificationsPRICE $34,750-$49,950 (est)LAYOUT Rear-motor, RWD, 2-, 5-, or 7-pass, 4-door vanMOTOR 200-350-hp/304 permanent-magnet electricTRANSMISSION 1-speed autoCURB WEIGHT 4,450-4,750 lb (mfr)WHEELBASE 112.2 inL x W x H 174.1 x 74.6 x 72.7 in0-60 MPH 6.9 sec (mfr est)EPA FUEL ECON Not yet rated (250-mile range, est)ON SALE Early 2023 (fleet), 2024 (retail)"
"Transpo/Electric Cars/CarsCanoo, struggling EV startup, is trying to stay afloat on government largesseCanoo, struggling EV startup, is trying to stay afloat on government largesse / The company is delivering vehicles to NASA and the US Army and designing battery packs for the Defense Department. It’s a far cry from the startup’s original plans for adventure-themed trucks and vans. By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Jul 12, 2023, 5:20 PM UTCShare this story Image: CanooWhen Canoo first unveiled its cool, futuristic-looking electric van back in 2021, a non-zero number of friends reached out to me to ask when they could buy one. The answer is probably never. Not unless they work for the federal government. The struggling EV startup has been on the verge of running out of money since last year. Its cash burn remains high, and analysts say it’s at risk for insolvency. Indeed, Canoo’s stock has been trading for less than a dollar, putting it at risk of being delisted from the stock exchange. But despite its financial woes, the federal government is more than happy to continue to do business with the company. Today, Canoo announced it had successfully delivered three crew transportation vehicles to NASA for use in the agency’s Artemis mission to the Moon. The vehicles were delivered to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where they will be used to transport the astronauts to the launch pad for the Artemis lunar missions starting next year.Today, Canoo announced it had successfully delivered three crew transportation vehicles to NASA for use in the agency’s Artemis mission to the MoonCanoo has also supplied EVs to the US Army for “analysis and demonstration.” Basically, the Army is testing the company’s Light Tactical Vehicle (LTV) to see whether it wants to order more of them for military purposes. The LTV is built on the same platform as Canoo’s Duplo toy-looking EV prototype truck that was first revealed in 2021.And this week, Canoo said it had “expanded” its partnership with the Defense Department’s Innovation Unit to develop high-capacity battery packs for use in military vehicles, as well as energy-dense batteries for the US Navy. It’s quite the pivot for the six-year-old company, which originally launched in a nearly zero-interest rate environment along with over a dozen other EV startups that all had dreams of becoming the next Tesla. Canoo planned to manufacture electric vans and trucks for customers interested in outdoor adventures — basically the same pitch as Rivian, which has also struggled but is now seeing its deliveries increase. Canoo was founded in late 2017 when former BMW executive Stefan Krause left then-floundering EV startup Faraday Future. Krause and some of the other executives who co-founded Canoo — which they originally called Evelozcity — were sued by Faraday Future for poaching employees and allegedly stealing trade secrets, though the lawsuit was settled in late 2018.The automaker has several EVs in the works, including the MPDV, a multi-purpose delivery van, and the Canoo Pickup Truck. The toyish truck showed just how far Canoo is willing to push the design of the microbus-style vehicle it first debuted back in 2019, which it originally planned to sell on a subscription-only basis.It’s unclear whether NASA or the Defense Department is concerned about Canoo’s gloomy financial outlook or how a possible Chapter 11 filing could affect its ongoing projects for the government. Neither agency responded to requests for comment. If Canoo’s financial outlook continues to worsen, its dreams of becoming the next Tesla may never be realized. But if NASA, the US Army, and other agencies see value in Canoo’s EVs, the company may actually turn out to be more like Elon Musk’s other company, with its bevy of lucrative government contracts: SpaceX.
